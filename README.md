### A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
### You can also decrease and increase the linked list at run-time. That is, you can allocate and deallocate memory at run-time itself. In this, you can easily do insertion and deletion functions. That is, you can easily insert and delete the node.
